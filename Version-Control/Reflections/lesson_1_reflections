6. How did viewing a diff between two versions help you
spot the bug?

Viewing a diff helped me spot the bug because there wasn't as much code to
look through so it was a lot faster. I could directly compare the code.

8. How could having easy access to the entire history
of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

This could make you a more efficient programmer because this allows you to go
through your mistakes and maybe find a better way of doing things.

15. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing
when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically
saved, like Google Docs does?

Manually choosing to create a commit can save time, this way you can write more
without saving all the time. Manually committing can also be bad. If you do 
something wrong and you didn't save that then your entire code could be 
destroyed. While automatic saving would have fixed that.

18. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git,
allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat
each file separately?

I think this is like this because this way you can get things done faster, and 
then you wouldn't have to save every minute.


22. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to
view the history of files?

Git log will show you the entire log of the code, and the different version. Git
 diff will compare two different versions and show you what you did differently.

26. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that 
could break something?

Version control will make you more confident because even if you make mistakes your
code will not be messed up and you can just go back and fix it.

31. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

There is nothing I want to use it for now. But maybe once I start making my game I 
can compare files just like the people on this site did.
