When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

You would want to use a remote repository because it is better when collaborating with other people on a project. That way you can share codes and other things.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might want to pull changes manually because this way you can change it when you want, instead of it changing it unexpectedly. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forking and cloning copy an entire repository to a different spot. You can only fork a GitHub repository to another location on GitHub. You can clone something wherever you would like. Branching is used to add new changes to a repository. You would clone a repository when you want to work on it locally, instead of just on GitHub. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

A benefit of having a copy is that it is easy to access. Also you can save even if you are not ready to merge. Then if you want you can perform the merge offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

Collaborating without using Git or GitHub would be pretty difficult because you would always be mixing up other people's changes. If I couldn't use Git or GitHub I would probably use a DropBox folder because it is kind of like Git and it can also design code.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

You would want to make changes in a separate branch when you are working with a large group. Some benefits of using branches is that it helps keep track of whihc changes have already been looked at and approved.
